Job Title: LLM Engineer

Job Description:
################
 - We are seeking a skilled and innovative LLM Engineer to join our AI team. The ideal candidate will 
   have hands-on experience in developing, fine-tuning, and deploying large language models (LLMs) for 
   various applications. You will collaborate with cross-functional teams to deliver cutting-edge AI 
   solutions, leveraging your expertise in natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, and 
   large-scale systems.


Key Responsibilities
####################
1.  Model Development:
    - Design and fine-tune large language models (e.g., GPT, LLaMA, or similar) for tasks like text generation, 
      summarization, question answering, and classification.
    - Implement advanced techniques for model optimization, including pruning, quantization, and distillation.

2.  Data Management:
    - Curate, preprocess, and manage large datasets for training and evaluation.
    - Ensure data quality by cleaning, augmenting, and annotating datasets.

3.  Infrastructure & Deployment:
    - Build scalable pipelines for training and deploying LLMs using frameworks like PyTorch, TensorFlow, or JAX.
    - Optimize inference speed and memory usage for production-grade applications.

4.  Model Evaluation:
    - Develop benchmarks to evaluate model performance, fairness, and safety.
    - Implement guardrails to mitigate bias and ensure ethical use of AI systems.

5.  Collaboration:
    - Work closely with product managers, data scientists, and software engineers to align model capabilities with business requirements.
    - Provide mentorship to junior team members and contribute to knowledge sharing within the team.

6.  Research & Innovation:
    - Stay updated on the latest research in NLP and deep learning.
    - Contribute to academic papers, patents, or open-source projects where appropriate.
